                <h2>Culture </h2>
                <h3>Ethnicity and Religion</h3>
                <table align="center">
                    <tr>
                        <td><img src="images/pic7.jpeg" alt=""></td>

                <p>Ethnicity can be regarded as one of the main key aspects to determine Sri Lanka culture. There are a number of ethnic groups residing in Sri Lanka. The Majority of them are Sinhalese and Tamils. Then there are Muslims who are further divided as Malays, Moors etc. Then burghers who were modern descendants of Portuguese, British and Dutch when Sri Lanka was a colony under them. Different ethnicities also speak different languages and some ethnic groups speak the same language more often. Another ethnic group is also available who are known as the "Vedda" community. They are the indigenous people of Sri Lanka who are still currently practicing primitive behavior(countrystudies.us, 2010) </p>
                <p>Religion can be the other key element determining Sri Lankan culture.There are 4 main religions in sri lanka which are:
                     <ol>
                    <li>Buddhism</li>
                    <li>Hinduism</li>
                    <li>Christianity</li>
                    <li>Islamism</li>
                </ol>

                    
                    Buddhism is the religion followed by the majority of the country who are the Sinhalese.
                    Hinduism is practised by the Tamils and it is prominet in the Northern region of sri lanka.
                    Sri lankan burghers are generally christians since they are indirect descendants from the Portuguese and Dutch.
                    Islamism is followed by Sri lanka Muslims and moors.
                    It is clear that Sri lanka is a whole big mix of Ethnicity and Religion making it's culture unique compared to other countries.

                    <h3>Food and Medicine</h3>
                    <p> food and drink has been controlled by Ancient Sri lankan culture and yet still some of these food are the cuurent staple food of our country and is still 
                    consumed by the locals of our country.Rice and cuury is considered the most popular dish among Sri lankan people.It's a combination of mainly rice and some vegetable
                    curries and meat too which makes it a very rich in terms of nutrition.The curries are bursting with unexplainable flavour because of the various spices used by Sri lankans such as 
                    Nutmeg,Cardomem(<i>Enasahal</i>) ,Clove(<i>Karabunati</i>) ,Goraka ,Corinader(<i>Kottamalli</i>) etc.Many of these spices are cultivated within the country.
                    On festive seasons Sri lanka celebrates Sinhala and Tamil new year and sweets such as Kavum,Kokis,Aluwa and many sweet meats could be found</p>

                    <p>Sri Lankan medicine has been mainly ayurweda.It is an ancient medicinal practice in which most of the medicinal practises are consuming antidotes and through massaging.
                        Ayurwedic doctors do not perform incisions and surgeries.
                        Many of these medicine and antidotes are made from local herbs.Ayurwedic practises are still very common in the rural areas of the country.
                    It is also to be mentioned that Sri lankan food is also very high in medicinal value and yet in some families people drink Kottamalli on a regular basis.
                    Due to this many Sri-lankas tend often to get sick and be a victim of cholestrol,High blood pressure and heart related conditions in which other countries exced at.  </p>
