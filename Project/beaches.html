                  <h2>Unawatuna beach</h2>
                  <p>Unawatuna is one of the biggest tourist destinations in Sri Lanka and is the most “famous” beach in the country.
                     It is a lovely banana-shaped beach of golden sand and turquoise water, surrounded by green palm trees.
                     It was the first beach we visited in Sri Lanka.<a href="https://www.araliyaresorts.com">Araliya resort</a>
                     We chose not to stay at one of the fancy and expensive hotels along the beach of Unawatuna, but a few kilometers away at a guesthouse.
                     <br><br> The beach is popular with tourists, and part of the beach is occupied with sunbeds for rent.
                     At the west end of the beach, there are some rocks and stairs that lead up to a small hill with a pagoda and a big Buddha statue.
                     It’s a nice little walk with a beautiful view overlooking the beach.Behind the beach, in between palm trees, is Unawatuna center.
                      In the street you can find mini jewellary stalls,sourvenier joints etc.Unawatuna Beach is really beautiful, with great swimming.
                      Hotel near to the beach:   </p>
