                    <p>These paintings can be found on the Western Surface of the Sigiriya Rock.
                        It is originally said that these Paintings were originally painted from white to showcase purity like the ancient gods.
                        It is said that king had a vast number of beautiful female servants and they were the ones who inspired for the artists to have golden colored skins.
                        The Sophisticated jewellary these women wore also indicates that they also may be part in the Royal Family possibly the King's Queen or his daughters.
                        Some people also say that these were goddeses or even Sacred women From different Tribes(Ex:Naga,Raksha).
